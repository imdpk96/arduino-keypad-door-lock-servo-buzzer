# 🔐 Arduino Keypad Password Lock with Servo Motor and Buzzer

A beginner-friendly smart door lock system made using **Arduino Uno**, **4x4 Keypad**, **SG90 Servo Motor**, **Buzzer**, and **LED**. This DIY project allows you to input a numeric password on the keypad. If the password is correct, the servo motor unlocks the lock, the LED blinks, and a buzzer indicates success. If the password is wrong, the buzzer alerts and the lock remains closed.
